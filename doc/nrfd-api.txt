nRF D-Bus API description
**************************

Service 	org.cesar.nrf

Adapter hierarchy
=================
Interface 	org.cesar.nrf.Adapter1
Object path 	[variable prefix]/{nrf0, nrf1, ...}

Methods 	void AddDevice(dict properties)

		Add a remote nRF device including its local stored
		data such as keys and properties. Properties has string
		PublicKey and string Name as optional and string Address,
		boolean Allowed, boolean Connected, object Adapter as mandatory

		Returns: org.cesar.nrf.Error.InvalidArguments

		void RemoveDevice(object device)

		Removes a remote nRF device including its local stored
		data such as keys, and properties.

		Returns: org.cesar.nrf.Error.InvalidArguments

Properties 	string Address [readonly]

		Persistent property. 64-bit nRF address.
		eg: 88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11 (MSB on left)


		boolean Powered [readwrite]

		Not persistent property. Switch nRF adapter on/off

		boolean Scan [readwrite]

		Setting this property makes the adapter start scanning for new
		devices.



Device hierarchy
================
Interface 	org.cesar.nrf.Device1
Object path 	[variable prefix]/{nrf0, nrf1, ...}/dev_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx


Methods 	void Bind(string PublicKey)

		This method allows to create persistent association. Key is
		optional, binding without key results on open physical channel.

		Returns: org.cesar.nrf.Error.AlreadyExists
			org.cesar.nrf.Error.InvalidArguments


Properties 	string Address [readonly]

		64-bit nRF address.
		eg: 88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11 (MSB on left)


		string Name [readonly, optional]

		nRF remote name. PropertiesChanged is emitted if this
		value changes.

		string PublicKey [readonly, optional]

		Key is optional, the absence of a value for this property
		results on open physical channel.

		boolean Allowed [readwrite]

		Indicates if the remote is allowed to connect.
		PropertiesChanged is emitted if this value changes.


		boolean Connected [readwrite]

		Indicates if the remote is currently connected.
		PropertiesChanged signal is emitted when this value
		changes.

		boolean Broadcasting [readwrite]

		Indicates if the remote is broadcasting presence.

		object Adapter [readonly]

		Object path of the nRF adapter associated with this device.
